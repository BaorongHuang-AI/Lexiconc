LexiConc is a freely available tool (www.lexiconc.info) that offers a unique  platform for the identification of discourse markers, lexical bundles, and visualisation of the targeted words. This tool can also perform keywords analysis with the keywords  (i.e., those words overrepresented in comparison to a general English reference corpus) being categorized according to three established external wordlists: (i) commonly occurring lexical bundles in general English; (ii) commonly occurring lexical bundles in academic English, and (iii) commonly occurring discourse markers and  (iv) visualisations.
